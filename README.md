# The-Battle-Cats-Unite-Editor
A save editor for the switch game "The Battle Cats Unite!".
I made this with the help of ChatGPT. You need to have Java installed on your PC in order to run the porgram. Currently you can edit the values ​​of the Cat Food, Rare tickets, Cat Tickets, Platinum Tickets and XP. I tested it in the 1.0.7 Japanese version and in the 1.0.0  Southeast Asia version. NOTE: if ypu create a save in the 1.0.0 Japanese version Platinum Tickets won't never work with the editot.
Furthermore, I would like to expand it to be able to edit the unlocked Units.
MAKE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING.
