# The-Battle-Cats-Unite-Editor
A save editor for the switch game "The Battle Cats Unite!".

You need to have Java installed on your PC in order to run the program. Currently you can edit the values ​​of the Cat Food, Rare tickets, Cat Tickets, Platinum Tickets, XP, Catfruits and Seeds and also unlock all the Units and complete Enemy Guide. 

I tested it in the 1.0.7 Japanese version and in the 1.0.0  Southeast Asia version (Catfruits, Seeds, Units and Enemies unlock only tested in 1.0.7 Japanese). 1.0.8 also works. 

NOTE: if you create a save in the 1.0.0 Japanese version Platinum Tickets won't work with the editor, even when you update the game.

MAKE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING.
