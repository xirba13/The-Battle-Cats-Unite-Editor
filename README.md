# The-Battle-Cats-Unite-Editor
A save editor for the switch game "The Battle Cats Unite!".
I made this with the help of ChatGPT. You need to have Java installed on your PC in order to run the porgram. Currently you can edit the values ​​of the Cat Food, Rare tickets, Cat Tickets, Platinum Tickets and XP. I tested it in 1.0.7 Japanese version.
Furthermore, I would like to expand it to be able to edit the unlocked Units.
